### Who are you and what’s your role at Appnovation?

As Manager of Experience, I’m the design lead for my projects, and for the Vancouver team. User experience is one of the growing areas of Appnovation. It’s a really interesting time to be part of the Experience team, offering new processes and new ways of thinking – we’re shaping how the company will deal with design in the future.

### What’s the greatest lesson you’ve learned, that you’d like to share with others?

Be early, be prepared, and listen more than you speak. I guess those are three things, but they really shape how people see you both in business and personal life.

### What are some of your hobbies and interests outside of work?

Music and fitness, but mostly music these days. As much as I want to be able to do everything all the time, sometimes one needs to focus. I have a few musical projects brewing and I’m determined to spend more time on stage this year.

### What aspect of work are you most excited about right now or tackling next?

Starting new projects! I love discovery meetings. I love the initial murky waters of discovery and strategy when you are absorbing huge loads of information and trying to make sense of it all. These are the puzzles that my brain likes to obsess with: the ones where you have to work hard to see the patterns, and the ones that give you a sense of ownership.

### BONUS QUESTION: What do you like best about working at Appnovation?

When you’ve been with a company for 10 years, you see so many changes that it’s almost like you’ve worked in multiple places. You work with such a variety of people in so many different projects, but one constant has been that we have a core group that are “doers” – people who are reliable and don’t shy from a challenge. Those are the people you need to surround yourself with.
